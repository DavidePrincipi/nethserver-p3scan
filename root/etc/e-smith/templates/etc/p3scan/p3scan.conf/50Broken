# Broken email clients
#
#   Some email clients may require special processing. If this
#   option is enabled the client will receive whole lines (vice
#   single characters) while processing a large email message.
#
#   The reason for leaving two types of large email processing
#   is that when this option is disabled, the possibility exists
#   that the client will not see any "X-P3Scan: Due to an
#   extremely large attachment you see this message line." in
#   the received message header.
#
#   Note: As of the introduction of this parameter, only some
#   instances of the use of the Outlook/Outlook Express clients
#   warrent enabling of this feature.
#
#   default: send characters during large message processing.
