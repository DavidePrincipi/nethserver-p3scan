# Template
#
#   Where to look for an email-template when our own mail has to be send
#   instead of an infected mail. That file has to be exist, otherwise
#   p3scan will send an RFC unconform -ERR and closes the connections.
#   The email-template should start after the header with the content-type, and
#   so on. Also the leading dot is necessary (just a dot and return, no more in
#   the last line). You can use some key- words which will be replaced
#   when sending, e.g. %MAILDATE%. See the existing p3scan-en.mail for examples
#   of keywords.
#
#   p3scan.mail is normally a sym-link to your default language email template.
#   You can of course just put the actual name of your template here.
#
#   default: /etc/p3scan/p3scan.mail
#
# template = /etc/p3scan/p3scan.mail
{
    $template = $p3scan{'Template'} || '/etc/p3scan/p3scan-en.mail';
    $OUT .= "template = $template";
}
